        This project demonstrates the real-time querying of a MySQL database using Streamlit. It provides:
        - **Institutional Queries**: Predefined queries related to business analytics and insights.
        - **Self-written Queries**: Custom queries for exploring the dataset.
        
        **Technologies Used**:
        - **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
        - **MySQL**: For database management and querying.
        - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and presentation.

        **Features**:
        - Dynamic query selection using dropdowns.
        - Stylish presentation with a user-friendly interface.
        - Real-time fetching of query results.
